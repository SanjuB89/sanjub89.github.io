            Visit one of the most striking lakes in the Henry M. Jackson
            wilderness. The vibrant blue of the glacier-fed lake provides the
            perfect rest stop for hikers who have braved the thirty-odd, steep
            switchbacks that lead to the lake. The trail starts in cool second
            growth forest, but the trees are quite sizable. In the fall, the
            squirrels roughhouse in the trees high above your head. Occasionally
            they drop gigantic pinecones from high above, and while the
            resulting crash is startling, it is fun to watch.

            The curiously-named Lake Twentytwo is the center of an oasis of
            alpine wetland nestled on the northern shoulder of Mount Pilchuck.
            The hike to the lake combines the best of mountain rainforests,
            old-growth, wetlands, and mountain views, yet it is readily
            accessible. In winter, the route to Lake 22 can be avalanche prone
            in winter. I was told it's best to wait until the snow is melted on
            this popular Mountain Loop Highway trail. Only way to acheive
            something new is doing something new.

            Hikers flock to Mount Storm King for that signature shot, standing
            on a rocky outcropping above Lake Crescent. But it's a grind to get
            there, and the climb to the summit can be dangerous in bad weather.
            It's still a steep hike to get to them, but at least it's shorter.
            From trailhead, after just a few minutes of hiking, arrive at huge
            boulder and a sign propped against it, pointing the way uphill via a
            180-degree turn. This is your turnoff for Storm King. You might want
            to take a few layers off.

            Despite its intermediate difficulty, Mount Pilchuck sees a slew of
            visitors in a given year, as hikers flock to the trail for its grand
            panoramic views and historic restored fire lookout.Its relatively
            short 2.7 mile but rewarding, 2,300 feet ascent gifts you 360-degree
            views of Mount Baker, Mount Rainier and the Olympics from its
            shelter lookout. This calf-friendly journey is all made possible by
            a high elevation trailhead, which sets you off on your travels
            around 3,000 feet, cutting what would otherwise be an arduous ten
            mile roundtrip in half.
