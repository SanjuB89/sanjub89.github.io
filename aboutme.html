            Born and raised in Kathmandu, Nepal which is located in between
            India and China; people also call it the top of the world. Mount
            Everest is one of the many tourist attractions of Nepal. <br />
            <br />
            Graduated high school with Physics major, and joined a web-page
            design course just for fun. I have been a computer science student
            since 2007. <br /><br />
            I have been a very active person since I was a child. I would take
            part in various activities like soccer, music, painting, basketball
            and many more. I was sent to one of the most popular schools of
            Nepal which was way off of my family's budget. My parent's struggle
            and dedication made me who I am today.

            Nirvana was the first band I consistently listened to when I was in
            the 5th grade and I got pretty obsessed with punk genre. In no time,
            I was drawn into heavy metal and psychedelia progressive rock. Iron
            Maiden is one the best bands I grew up playing. I play drums, guitar
            and learning piano right now.
